A simple plugin that allows describing a project, which is a set of files that
can be easily loaded into the editor "at once", as opposed to having to open
each file separately.

The plugin registers a normal-mode keybind, `<leader>lp`, which will "load"
the project. This requires the existence of a file named `.project.lua` in the
current working directory.

An example of the contents of this file would be something like this:

	require('cproject').setup {
		exclude = { '.git', '.gitignore' }
	}

When the project is "loaded", all the files under the current working directory
will be loaded into the editor. Any files that match either `.git` or `.gitinore`
will be excluded. In the case of the first entry, since it represents a directory,
it will also cause the files contained in it to be excluded as well.

The plugin supports specifying a function that will be called for each file that
is "loaded" into the editor. This function is called when the current active
buffer is the file that was just "loaded", so it allows to set buffer-local
options.

	require('cproject').setup {
		for_each_file = function()
			vim.cmd.setlocal('spell spelllang=en_us')
		end
	}
